# Fav_Movies_file
This program creates a file to store your listed movies by given genres.
Still needs work. We'll need to create an if/else statement so as to not over-write the file when a previous user returns to add more genres and titles.
Now that I'm thinking about it, another feature for future addition would be to ensure that a previously placed movie title or genre name isn't repeated.
